# LinqTs - Typesycript Linq library

Typescript Linq library with prototype extensions for Array's. By comparing with other Linq javascript libraries we are getting the fastest results.

This library was implemented by a C# user. So C# users should not have any problems to come into this system.

## Implementation
The implementation is based on prototype extensions of the array object. I have tried to adjust the calling signatures similar to the C# linq implementations.

## Naming conventions
The naming conventions are not javascript / typescript standard. I have choosen naming where the first charachter is uppercase to avoid inteference with other methods. For example, an forEach method exists and standard typescript. 

## Older version + performance tests
The first implementation of this framework you can find [here](http://tslinq.codeplex.com/). There you can find the tests and the performance comparisations. This implementation does not contain prototype extensions and is implemented as separate classes. The implementation byitself where not changed, only the way you can use it.
